 I always get the shakes before a drop.
I’ve had the injections, of course,
and hypnotic preparation, and it stands to reason that I can’t really be afraid.
The ship’s psychiatrist has checked my brain waves and asked me silly questions
while I was asleep and he tells me that it isn’t fear, it isn’t anything important —
it’s just like the trembling of an eager race horse in the starting gate. I couldn’t
say about that; I’ve never been a race horse. But the fact is: I’m scared silly, every time.
At D-minus-thirty, after we had mustered in the drop room of theRodger Young , our platoon leader
inspected us. He wasn’t our regular platoon leader, because Lieutenant Rasczak had bought it on our
last drop; he was really the platoon sergeant, Career Ship’s Sergeant Jelal. Jelly was a Finno-Turk
from Iskander around Proxima — a swarthy little man who looked like a clerk, but I’ve seen him tackle
two berserk privates so big he had to reach up to grab them, crack their heads together like coconuts,
step back out of the way while they fell.
